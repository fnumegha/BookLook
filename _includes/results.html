      <p>We use Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees and KNN to classify and predict whether the target user
        loves or hates the target item. We see that SVM and Logistic Regression perform the best of all. 
        We used the classic method of prediction, the Matrix Factorization method to evaluate our love-hate model. The SVD model was
         implemented and it was found that the RMSE values are actually lesser for the LHSCM and the recall values for hate were not 
        that great for SVD. Hence, our model performs better than SVD giving a RMSE
         of 0.62 for Logistic Regression and a recall value of 0.95 for hate for SVM. 
        A point here to be noted is that we want the recall value for hate to be high, so that nothing which is actually hated
        is seen as love and recommended to the user!</p>
